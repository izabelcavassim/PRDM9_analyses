Introduction
============

This repository was created to outline the analyses described in the paper Cavassim et al., 2020 of which we extracted all the RefSeq data available and searched for genes coevolving with PRDM9. Multiple steps until the final results were executed and will be described in their chrnological order here. 
Main analyzes are: 
1. Verifying PRDM9 calls using RNA-seq data. (RNAseq_analyses.md)
2. Identifying orthologs of candidate genes across vertebrates (339 species). (Orthologous_search.md)
3. Phylogenetic independent contrats of PRDM9 and candidate genes. (PIC.Rmd)

Some of the data will be provided here, if not in the following repository https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11672685

Each of these steps will be explained in a different .md file which is placed in this repository.
